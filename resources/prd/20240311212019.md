## Original Requirements

Create a Solidity supply chain system smart contract. The smart contract owner can update items for the system

## Project Name

supply_chain_system

## Product Goals

- Ensure secure and transparent tracking of items in the supply chain
- Enable easy updates and management of items by the contract owner
- Optimize for gas efficiency and contract scalability

## User Stories

- As a contract owner, I want to add new items to the supply chain
- As a contract owner, I want to update the status of items in the supply chain
- As a user, I want to verify the authenticity and status of items in the supply chain
- As a developer, I want the smart contract to be easily integrable with front-end applications

## Competitive Analysis

- SupplyChainSmartContract A: Offers basic functionality but lacks gas efficiency
- BlockchainSupplyTracker B: High security and transparency but not user-friendly for contract owners
- ItemAuthenticator C: Focuses on item authentication but lacks comprehensive supply chain management features
- EthereumSupplyChain D: Well-rounded features but high gas costs
- SupplyChainSolutions E: Good scalability but complex for new users
- SmartSupplyChain F: User-friendly but compromises on security features
- ChainManager G: Excellent integration capabilities but lacks detailed documentation

## Requirement Analysis

The project requires a Solidity smart contract for managing a supply chain. Key functionalities include adding and updating items by the contract owner, and item verification by users. The contract must prioritize security, transparency, and efficiency.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Implement functions for adding and updating items in the supply chain']
- ['P0', 'Ensure high security and transparency for all transactions']
- ['P1', 'Design for gas efficiency to minimize transaction costs']
- ['P1', 'Provide easy integration with front-end applications']
- ['P2', 'Develop comprehensive documentation for developers and users']

## UI Design draft

N/A - The project focuses on the backend smart contract development. UI integration will be considered in future phases.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the specific types of items to be managed in the supply chain and any specific user roles besides the contract owner.
