## Implementation approach

We will develop a Solidity smart contract named 'SupplyChainContract' to manage the supply chain system. The contract will allow the owner to add and update items, ensuring high security and transparency. We'll use OpenZeppelin's contracts for secure ownership and state management. To optimize for gas efficiency, we'll minimize storage operations and use events for logging. The contract will be designed for easy integration with front-end applications, providing clear interfaces and functions.

## Data structures and interfaces

    class SupplyChainContract {
        -address owner
        -mapping(uint256 => Item) items
        +addItem(string name, string description) public
        +updateItem(uint256 itemId, string status) public
        +getItem(uint256 itemId) public view returns(Item)
        +transferOwnership(address newOwner) public
    }
    class Item {
        +uint256 id
        +string name
        +string description
        +string status
        +uint256 timestamp
    }
    SupplyChainContract --> Item : contains


## Program call flow


sequenceDiagram
    participant O as Owner
    participant SC as SupplyChainContract
    participant I as Item
    O->>SC: addItem(name, description)
    SC->>I: create Item
    I-->>SC: return Item
    SC-->>O: confirm addition
    O->>SC: updateItem(itemId, status)
    SC->>I: update status
    I-->>SC: return updated Item
    SC-->>O: confirm update
    participant U as User
    U->>SC: getItem(itemId)
    SC->>I: fetch Item
    I-->>SC: return Item
    SC-->>U: display Item


## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on the specific types of items to be managed in the supply chain and any specific user roles besides the contract owner.
